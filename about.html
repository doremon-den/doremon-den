        ABOUT US

        <p>You want to know about us or about Doremon? Well, we all know Doremon, don’t we?</p>
        <p>Every time Nobita used to cry, Doremon quickly understood his pain points and shipped out a gadget that’d almost instantaneously cheer Nobita up!</p>
        <p>So Why Doremon Den? It's a den of PMs helping Doremon deliver gadgets full of utility for users like Nobita.</p>
    </br>
        <p>2 IITians, when themselves faced problems while preparing for Product Management interviews, came up with this noble idea of helping similar confused folks.</p>

        <p>We organise 1-month camps to teach Product Management using the principle of 'Learning by doing'.</p>
        
        Our 3 salient features:
        <ul>
        <li>Interactive learning model - There’s no solo game in PM</li>
        <li>Product Sense focussed - Coz it’s more than frameworks</li>
        <li>Gamified for Undergrads - Doremon wants Anushaasan!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Doremon Den, registered as Doremon Den since 18th June 2021, has always strived to democratise education in India keeping students in mind.<p></p>
